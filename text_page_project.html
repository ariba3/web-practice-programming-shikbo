  <p style="text-align: justify; background-color: yellow; font-size: 20px;"><b>Bangladesh,</b>  country of South Asia, located in the delta of &nbsp; &nbsp; the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) &nbsp; &nbsp; rivers in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
  <h4>Bangladesh</h4>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">The riverine country of Bangladesh <b><i><sub>(“Land of the Bengals”) </sub> </i> </b> is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and its people are predominantly Muslim. 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh, with its capital at <b>Dhaka.</b></p>
  <h4>Land</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Bangladesh is bordered by the Indian states of West Bengal to the west and north, Assam to the north, Meghalaya to the north and northeast, and Tripura and Mizoram to the east. To the southeast, it shares a boundary with Myanmar (Burma). The southern part of Bangladesh opens into the Bay of Bengal.

<br> 
  Stretching northward from the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh constitutes roughly the eastern two-thirds of the deltaic plain of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers. Except for small higher areas of jungle-covered old alluvium (rising to about 100 feet [30 metres]) in the northwest and north-centre—in the Barind and the Madhupur Tract, respectively—the plain is a flat surface of recent alluvium, having a gentle slope and an elevation of generally less than 30 feet (9 metres) above sea level. In the northeast and southeast—in the Sylhet and Chittagong Hills areas, respectively—the alluvial plains give place to ridges, running mainly north-south, that form part of the mountains that separate Bangladesh from Myanmar and India. In its southern region, Bangladesh is fringed by the Sundarbans, a huge expanse of marshy deltaic forest.</p>
